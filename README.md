## Overall Instructions

The challenge is composed of 3 problems. Please try to complete all of the
problems, but don’t panic if you aren’t able to, you won’t be disqualified.
Overall, this challenge isn’t about just getting the ‘right’ answer, it’s
about writing good code.

Feel free to use any programming language which we can run without excessive
setup, on a typical Ubuntu desktop. Please choose a language which will best
demonstrate your skills for the role(s) you're applying for.

Using the web for help is perfectly fine, but be sensible: if a critical chunk
of your solution is copied from a github repo, that’s clearly not ok. Use of
external libraries is discussed separately for each problem. Remember that
your solution should demonstrate your ability as well as possible. Any
significant use of external code must be referenced. For clarity, plagiarism
or illegal reuse of code is not allowed.

### How to test your solutions

The challenge uses input/output file based testing. Your solution to each
problem needs to read an input from a text file, then output the answer to
another text file in the same location with the same name and the suffix
".answer" appended to the name.

**Your programs must be designed to take in a single command-line argument
that will be an absolute path to the input file. For example, if you use Python
, we will run your programs as follows.**

```
python your-hash-solution.py /home/johndoe/challenge/input/hash-1.txt
```

In this case, your program should output the answer to
`/home/johndoe/challenge/input/hash-1.txt.answer`.

There are example input and output files provided for each problem, which you
can use as a baseline for testing your code. For example, your solution to
Problem 1 should be able to read the contents of `hash-1.txt` in the `input`
folder and produce a file called `hash-1.txt.answer` in the same folder, whose
content is _exactly_ equal to that of the `hash-1.txt.example.answer`
file.

Your code will be tested automatically (using the supplied tests and others)
and reviewed manually. Please do not assume that input files will be well-
formed (e.g. your code should appropriately handle unexpected characters in
the input file). Please use the linux-style newlines in your files (`\n`,
ASCII code 10). Note that your output files **should not have a newline at the
end of the file**.

### What we’re looking for

Please approach each problem as though you were starting the code for a new
Littledata product. At a high level, a great solution is one which:

- Delivers all of the desired functionality
- Could be picked up by a colleague and understood quickly
- Could be extended or reworked in the future
- Uses the features of your chosen programming language well
- Handles unexpected inputs appropriately

To be specific, your code will be evaluated for:

- Functionality (whether it solves the problem)
- Approach (e.g. algorithm design)
- Code quality (e.g. appropriate use of functions)
- Cleanliness (e.g. variable naming)
- Performance (speed, less important)

### What to submit and how

We have sent you this challenge as an archive. Please add your solutions to
the 3 problems **as separate files** at the root of this, as well as a file
called `notes.txt`, and then email the zip archive back to us.

The notes.txt file should include:

- Brief instructions on how to run your code
- Any notes we should bear in mind (e.g. why you made an unusual choice)
- A brief note on what you found hardest about the challenge
- A brief note on how you could improve your code further
- Any feedback to us on how to improve either the challenge itself or the
  recruitment process so far

## Problem 1: Hash Iterator

### Problem description

The first problem is to create a brute force
[**_hash_**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function) iterator. This takes
two inputs, **a salt** and **an integer X**, and generates a
**10-character string** over the course of a large number of iterations.

In each iteration, your code will try to find a single character in the
10-character string. Each iteration will proceed as follows:

- Start with the salt, which is an ASCII encoded string
- Append the iteration number to the salt, starting at 1 to form an input
  string for the hash function
- Find the hexadecimal representation of the MD5 hash of this input string
  (salt + iteration number)
- If the hash starts with **X** zeros, where **X** is the integer from the
  input, you have a match
- Once you have a match, you run 2 operations to work out a character of your
  output:
  - Find the character following the **X** zeros. This is the index of the
    match in the output hash string
  - In order to find the character that you put in this index position, find
    the result (**M**) of performing a modulo operation, with the divisor being the
    hash length (32 bits), on your current iteration number. The character
    in position **M** in the hash is the character in your output

This process is repeated until all 10 characters are found. Do not overwrite
previously found characters.

### Example

**Input:**

```
machine-learning,4
```

**Expected output:**

```
f320e001d1
```

**Logic run-through:**
Your solution starts by appending `'1'` to the salt which gives
(`"machine-learning1"`), and the hash of this is then
found: `"e3aaf8288a4bd99222f8960f39e24816"`. This doesn’t start with 4 zeros,
so the next iteration is conducted.

This continues iterating, and on the 281382nd iteration you hash
`"machine-learning281382"` and get `"000045eeb68e49d94edb7c6faf93b301"`.
This has the specified 4 zeros at the beginning, and so is used to find a
character of the output. 281382 modulo 32 is 6, and so the character with
index 6 of the hash is used (assuming zero indexing), which is `'e'`. The
number after the zeroes is 4, so the character of the output string to be
updated is at index 4. Therefore, `'e'` goes in position 4, so the output
string is `....e.....` (where `.` indicates an unknown character), again
assuming zero indexing.

After 6854736 iterations, you should have filled all the positions in the
string, and arrived at the string `f320e001d1`.

### Extra notes

- You are welcome to use external libraries
- Your answer should always be 10 characters long
- Use only the first result for each position
- Ignore non-numeric positions. For example, ignore a hash starting with `0000c`
- The output file should contain just the string (no newlines, no spaces or
  extra characters)

## Problem 2: Pathfinding

### Problem description

The second problem is to create a map and then find the shortest path from a
start location to an end location. Think of it as being a pirate in search of
treasure.

The input file, a coded message left behind by a fellow pirate, contains
comma-separated coordinates, which detail your starting location, the location
of the treasure, and the locations of dangerous reefs on the ocean, that you
cannot sail over. The first correctly formatted coordinate in a file is your
starting position, and the last correctly formatted coordinate is the location
of the treasure. All other coordinates are reefs that you cannot sail through.
Reefs alone define the extent of the map.

Before you can find the shortest path to the treasure, you need to process the
information you have collected from your pirate buddies while sailing the seas.

Start by developing a parsing function which takes the input file, and
produces a map.

Each coordinate file contains data in the following form: `x4y1,x1y2,x5y2`.
The first number is the x coordinate, the second is the y coordinate. Exclude
any coordinates that are not in the specified format.

Once you have created the map, you’ll have to find the shortest way to get to
the treasure. Use a
[path-finding algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathfinding) to find
the steps that take you from the start position to the end location along the
shortest route. You can only sail directly up, down, left or right (no
diagonal sailing), and you are not allowed to sail outside of the map.

Once you have found the shortest path, output the complete map to a file using
the following legend:

- Sea: `.`
- Reef: `x`
- Start: `S`
- End (treasure): `E`
- Path to take: `O`

If you find that there is no path in the ocean, or that your start or end
position doesn’t make sense (e.g. it lies outside the map), output the word
“error” to the output file.

### Example

**Input:**

```
x0y0,x0y1,x1y1,
x3y2,x2y2
```

The start coordinate is hence x0y0, while the treasure lies at x2y2. We mark
these as `S` and `E`. That gives us a map like this:

```
S...
xx..
..Ex
```

We find the shortest path that connects the start and end points by sailing
through the ocean. We mark the path with `O`, which yields us the final map.
**Output file:**

```
SOO.
xxO.
..Ex
```

### Extra notes

- **For this problem, please find a suitable library to use for pathfinding,
  rather than implementing your own algorithm**
- If there are multiple shortest paths, output just one of them
- The oceans are vast. Coordinates may span multiple lines and maps can be
  quite large
- Coordinates are zero-indexed
- The origin of the coordinate axes is at the top left

## Problem 3: Scrabble

### Problem description

Create a program to find the best move in a game of scrabble. This is a test
of your ability to design and implement an algorithm to solve a problem. Unlike
with the rest of the challenge - we request that you implement an algorithm to
solve this part rather than using a library.

It is also designed to be harder - we do not expect everyone to whom we would
offer a position to be able to solve it fully.

The input to your challenge is a
[Scrabble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrabble) board and a panel of letter
tiles.
These are both detailed in a single file, where the last line describes your
panel of letter tiles, and the rest of the file describes the scrabble board.

For example, imagine your tiles are `panelyy` and the board is as shown below:
![Scrabble Board](https://static.vecteezy.com/system/resources/previews/000/090/550/original/scrabble-board-free-fector-vector.jpg)

The corresponding input file would be:

```
---------------
---------------
---------------
--------smile--
-----------a---
-----------u---
-----------g-h-
-------birthday
-------------p-
-------------p-
-------------y-
---------------
---------------
---------------
---------------
panelyy
```

Your task is to find what to add to the board from your panel to achieve the
highest score possible. Your output should be formed as
`(x_start,y_start,vertical,word)`, where `x_start` and `y_start` are integer
coordinates of the first tile of the word, `vertical` is a boolean (true if the
word is vertical), and `word` is a string.

The scores for each letter are:

```
1:EAIONRTLSU
2:DG
3:BCMP
4:FHVWY
5:K
8:JX
10:QZ
```

Your solution should be a "play" as if it were your turn in Scrabble, using only
the letters available to you in your panel.

To quote the Scrabble Wikipedia article:

> A proper play uses one or more of the player's tiles to form a continuous
> string of letters that make a word (the play's "main word") on the board,
> reading either left-to-right or top-to-bottom. The main word must either use the
> letters of one or more previously played words or else have at least one of its
> tiles horizontally or vertically adjacent to an already played word. If any
> words other than the main word are formed by the play, they are scored as well,
> and are subject to the same criteria of acceptability.

For the above board with the panel "panelyy", one of the top-scoring solutions
is "yay", when placed vertically such that the last "y" makes the word
"smiley", with a score of 20.

The score of your move is calculated as the **sum of the score of every new word
which you create** as a result of your move. In this example move, the words
"smiley" and "yay" are created. "smiley" has a score of **11**, and "yay" has a
score of **9**. The total score for this move is therefore **20**. Note that
the **'y'** at the end of "smiley" and at the start of "yay" is counted
**twice**, once for each word.

### Example

**Input:**

```
---------------
---------------
---------------
--------smile--
-----------a---
-----------u---
-----------g-h-
-------birthday
-------------p-
-------------p-
-------------y-
---------------
---------------
---------------
---------------
panelyy
```

**Output:**

```
(13,1,true,yay)
```

### Extra notes

- Please don’t use existing libraries designed to solve this problem. You may
  still use common libraries for I/O, data structures etc, just remember the
  core of this problem is making the algorithm yourself
- Words can only read left-to-right and top-to-bottom
- We have provided a dictionary of valid words, `dict.txt`. Please use this,
  without modification
- Whilst scrabble has locations which double or triple your letter or word
  score, assume these don’t exist for this problem
- Additionally, unlike regular scrabble you don’t get a bonus for using all
  your letters
- If there are multiple answers which give the same (best) score, output any
  one of them
- The top left corner of the board has coordinates 0,0

**_Good Luck!_**
