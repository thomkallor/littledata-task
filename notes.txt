- Brief instructions on how to run your code
* The system must be installed with the latest version of node.
* I am compressing the directory with the node modules, if you want you can run npm installed.
* The solutions to the questions are in file hash-1, path-2, scrabble-3 of the root directory.
* You can run the file using node `filename` `Path_to_input_file`.

- Any notes we should bear in mind (e.g. why you made an unusual choice)
* The 3rd question (scrabble) is not fully completed given the time constrain and may not give the best results.
* I haven't checked the possibilty of making a word from non-continuous letters on the board (parallelly).
* The possibility of making multiple words by arranging them parallelly is not implemented either.
* The scrabble code is not well tested either and may raise error on occassion.

- A brief note on what you found hardest about the challenge
* The 3rd question was probably the hardest and took the majority of my time.
* Surprisingly I couldn't find a lot a data structure library in nodejs that is well maintained.

- A brief note on how you could improve your code further
* The code may gives errors if meet with an unexpected input(error checks have to be performed further).
* The 3rd question could be further cleaned up and split the code into smaller components.
* Unit test cases can be written to ensure proper functionality.
